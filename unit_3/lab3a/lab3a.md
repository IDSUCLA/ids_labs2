Lab 3A

Directions: Follow along with the slides and answer the questions in **red** font in your journal.




Conducting experiments
===

- Previously in class, you conducted an experiment to gauge how a stimulus affected people's perception of time.
    - Some people were given a treatment, others were not.
- In this lab, we'll use the data cycle to analyze the _research question_:

_Does the stimulus your class chose change people's perception of time?_


Coming up with questions
===

- **Write down two statistical questions that will help you answer the _research question_ from the previous slide.**
- Then, _export_, _upload_, _import_ your experiment data into RStudio.
    - If you're having trouble coming up with good statistical questions, try loading the data and looking at the variables.
    - Ask yourself, _How would I use these variables to answer the research question?_

  

Analyzing our data
===

- Create appropriate plots to answer your statistical questions.
    - **Are there any outliers or unusual observations that require some cleaning before you can interpret your plots?**
- Calculate appropriate numerical summaries to answer your statistical questions.
- Interpret your plots and summaries.
    - **Write down a few sentences with your interpretations.**

Wrapping it up
===

- Is it possible your initial results occurred by chance alone?
    - **Use repeated shuffling to determine how likely the typical difference between the two groups occurred by chance alone.**
    - **Create a plot and use it to justify your answer.**
- What do you conclude about the _research question_?
    - **Write a report using the plots and analysis you conducted to answer the _research question_.**
    - Be sure to describe how you conducted your experiment.
