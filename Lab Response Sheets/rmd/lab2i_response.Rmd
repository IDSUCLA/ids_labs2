**Directions: Record your responses to the lab questions in the spaces provided.**

\newline

Is the distribution close to normal? Explain how you determined this. Describe the center and spread of the distribution.

\newline

\newline

\newline

Compute the mean difference in the age of the _actual_ survivors and the actual non-survivors.

\newline

\newline

\newline

Draw a sketch of a normal curve. Label the mean age difference, based on your shuffles, and the actual age difference of suvivors minus non-survivors from the actual data. Then, shade in the areas, under normal the curve, that are _smaller_ than the actual difference.

\newline

Were women on the Titanic typically younger than men?

\newline

\newline

\newline

Use a histogram, 500 random shuffles and a normal model to answer the question in the bullet above.
