**Directions: Record your responses to the lab questions in the spaces provided.**

\newline

Describe, in words, how the line fits the data? Are there any values for `critics_rating` that would make obviously poor predictions?

\newline

\newline

\newline

Compute the MSE of the model for the `testing` data and write it down for later.

\newline

\newline

\newline

What is the role of the number `2` in the `poly()` function?

\newline

\newline

\newline

Write down the model equation in the form:

\newline

\newline

\newline

Compare how the _line of best fit_ and the _quadratic_ model fit the data. Use the difference in each model's testing MSE to describe why one model fits better than the other.
